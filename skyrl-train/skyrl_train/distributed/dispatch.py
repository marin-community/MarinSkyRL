class DispatchPutTimeoutError(RuntimeError):
    """Raised by `_ray_put_bounded` when a dispatch-loop `ray.put()` does not return
    within `SKYRL_DISPATCH_PUT_TIMEOUT_S` seconds.

    WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-07-10, 80B v4/v5 wedge): `MeshDispatch.dispatch` below is a
    plain synchronous Python `for` loop calling `ray.put()` inline once per dp-group
    (the R3-resident-set fix, ac4b3806/6cfee800). It is called *inline* (not via
    `asyncio.to_thread`) from `Worker.async_run_method` / `async_run_ray_method`
    (worker.py), so it runs directly on the trainer's own asyncio event-loop thread.
    Unlike every other blocking primitive in this codebase (NCCL collectives all have
    an explicit watchdog/heartbeat timeout: SKYRL_WORKER_NCCL_TIMEOUT_IN_S,
    TORCH_NCCL_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_SEC, VLLM_ROUTED_EXPERTS_SIDE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS,
    VLLM_EXECUTE_MODEL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS, override_timeout_sec, ...), this `ray.put()`
    call has NO bound at all: if it stalls (object-store capacity/eviction pressure,
    a slow/unresponsive R2 spill target, or an object still pinned by a stuck
    consumer task), the loop never reaches the next dp-group's `ray.put()`, so those
    dp-groups' actors are NEVER dispatched a `forward.remote()` call at all -- and
    the failure is invisible until some unrelated downstream watchdog (NCCL
    heartbeat, hours later) finally fires. See
    agent_logs/2026-07-09_80b_v5_98k_nccl_wedge_kill.md: the finelog shows
    `R3_RESIDENT_SET method=forward dp=0` exactly once and dp=1.. never, and the
    unconditional post-loop `MESH_DISPATCH ... issued forward.remote() to N actors`
    summary (logged only once every actor_info has been dispatched) never fires even
    once across the whole 928MB log -- i.e. this loop provably never completes.

    This does NOT claim to fix the underlying trigger (still uncertain -- see the
    commit message); it converts a silent, multi-hour, whole-job-idle stall into a
    fast, loud, retryable failure, matching this codebase's dominant "nothing blocks
    forever without an explicit timeout" idiom.

    `ray.put()` has no native timeout param, so the put runs on a daemon helper
    thread and this function waits on it with `Thread.join(timeout=...)`. On timeout
    we raise `DispatchPutTimeoutError` immediately -- we do NOT wait for or cancel
    the helper thread (Ray gives no cancel API for an in-flight `ray.put()`); the
    thread is a daemon so it cannot block process exit, and the caller is expected to
    let the exception propagate and the process restart (the launcher's
    `--max-retries` already handles this).

    `timeout_s <= 0` disables the bound entirely -> byte-identical to a bare

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Fix A -- R3 de-centralization (SKYRL_R3_DECENTRAL, default ON as of 2026-07-11)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# WHY (2026-07-10, 80B head-plasma overflow). The `SKYRL_R3_RESIDENT` fix
# (ac4b3806) deduped the per-actor R3 fan-out to one `ray.put` per dp-group, but
# that `ray.put` runs ON THE DRIVER, so the multi-GB `rollout_routed_experts`
# (R3) chunk still lands in the DRIVER (head-node) plasma and stays PINNED there
# for the whole ~800s forward (the live `forward.remote()` tasks BORROW the
# driver-owned object). At 80B (8 dp-groups x ~4.6GB + the async-generation
# backlog) this overflows the head object store -> the dp=1 put stalls ->
# DispatchPutTimeoutError at global_step 1 (see
# agent_logs/2026-07-09_80b_v5_98k_nccl_wedge_kill.md). Prior frameworks
# (prime-rl / verl / slime) never centralize R3 in the head.
#
# WHAT this does. When SKYRL_R3_DECENTRAL=1, the per-dp-group chunk is
# materialized into the plasma of a CONSUMER (dp-group) NODE instead of the
# driver: a tiny NodeAffinity-scheduled task runs on that node and RETURNS the
# chunk unchanged. Ray stores a task's return value in the EXECUTING worker's
# node object store (the driver owns only the metadata / ref-count, not the
# bytes). The dp-group's `forward.remote()` calls then borrow a
# consumer-node-resident object, so the HEAD plasma holds ~0 R3 for the forward's
# duration. The driver's transient arg copy (the implicit put Ray makes to ship
# the chunk to the relocate task) is unreferenced the moment that task fetches it
# (seconds), NOT pinned for the ~800s forward -> head footprint becomes O(1) in
# model scale.
#
# CORRECTNESS. This changes only WHERE the chunk's bytes reside, never the value.
# The relocate task is a pure pass-through (`return chunk`), so the object the
# forward actors dereference is byte-identical to the driver-side
# `ray.put(chunk)` it replaces (same `data.chunk` rows, same Ray serialization).
# All upstream row / dp / CP / micro-batch alignment (#6335) lives in the collate
# + chunk path and is inherited UNCHANGED -- exactly the property the
# SKYRL_R3_RESIDENT fix relied on. Set SKYRL_R3_DECENTRAL=0 to force the old
# driver-put behavior (strict A/B isolation); default is now ON (2026-07-11) so
# the head-plasma DispatchPutTimeout footgun does not recur at scale.
#
# SCOPE (honest). This removes the PINNED driver residency (the wedge cause) but
# not the driver's TRANSIENT ship of each chunk (the driver still assembles the
# batch and puts each dp-chunk once to ship it). Eliminating even the transient
# would require a gen-worker-resident R3 capture rewrite (a dp-chunk's R3 spans
# many generation workers, so concat+pad+chunk needs driver materialization) that
# touches the capture->train alignment path -> deferred as a follow-up.
