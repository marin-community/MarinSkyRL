"""Verify an expert-block sync by replaying it (``generator.expert_block_sync.verify``).

Every root sends its weights again. Each receiver receives them into scratch and counts the
bytes that differ from its installed weights. It also checks that the bytes it compared add up
to all the parameter bytes it holds, counting only the HF rows of a padded vocabulary tensor.
Each trainer rank checks that its data-parallel peers hold identical bytes, because any of
them can be a root.

A replay sends about as many bytes as a sync.
