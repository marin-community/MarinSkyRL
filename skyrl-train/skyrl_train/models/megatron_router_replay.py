"""Megatron router replay (R3) — layout math and controller, megatron-free.

Everything here is CPU-testable without the ``megatron`` extra: the capture
layer mapping, the sequence-major flatten that mirrors mcore's router view
(``[S, B, E].view(-1, E)`` ⇒ token index ``s*B + b``), the TP sequence-parallel
slice, the per-layer replay controller, and the geometry validation. The
install step that touches real ``TopKRouter`` objects lives in
``skyrl_train.workers.megatron.router_replay_install``.

Controller lifecycle (per micro-batch forward through mcore's pipeline
scheduler)::

    controller.begin_forward(per_layer_targets, mask, response_mask)
    out = model(...)                      # each local router fires once
    controller.end_forward()
    ...
    controller.assert_drained()           # after every mini-batch / forward-only pass

Under activation recompute the router fires again during backward. Those calls
arrive in ``IDLE`` phase and are served from a per-layer FIFO recorded during
``FORWARD``, mirroring mcore's own ``RouterReplay`` design but keyed on the
global ``layer_number`` instead of a global instantiation-order list.
