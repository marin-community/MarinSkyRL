"""Rollout buffer: leases generation capacity to rollout workers and selects training batches.

A rollout worker writes each completed prompt group through a ``RolloutWriter``. The writer checks the
group's content where the payload already is, stores the payload in the run's payload store
(``skyrl_train.rollouts.payloads``), and commits a small verdict together with a reference to the payload, so
the buffer, a Ray actor, selects batches without reading payloads. The trainer fetches only the payloads it
trains on.
