"""Rollout payload stores: where a written group waits between its worker's write and the trainer's read.

``MemoryPayloads`` keeps each trainable group in Ray's object store, owned by the process that wrote it: the
driver, or a rollout worker whose failure already fails training. A checkpoint copies the groups.
``ObjectStorePayloads`` writes each trainable group to its own object under a root directory, usually an S3
prefix, before its verdict reaches the buffer. The trainer reads each group by its URI, the root keeps every
trainable group the run generated, and a checkpoint records only the URIs.

Payload reads and writes run on their own thread pools. The default executor also runs rollout work, such as
GenRM grading, that can hold a thread for minutes, and a read queued behind it stalls training.
