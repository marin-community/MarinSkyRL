"""Potential-based shaping (PBS) on edit tokens (Stage C / F6).

Mechanism 1 of the loop-behavior reward plan: credit the *edit* that moved the
in-trajectory test suite toward green, densifying RLOO-N's single outcome scalar
onto the specific edit tokens — **without** opening a reward-hacking optimum.

Why potential-based shaping (Ng, Harada & Russell 1999): a shaping reward of the
form ``F(s, s') = γ·Φ(s') − Φ(s)`` is **policy-invariant** — adding it to the
environment reward leaves the set of optimal policies unchanged, so it provably
**cannot** introduce a reward-hacking optimum. We therefore implement F as a true
potential difference, NOT as an ad-hoc per-edit bonus.

Construction (this module):
  * Potential ``Φ(state) = f(fraction of tests passing so far)`` from the F2
    parser's per-test-run ``(passed, total_runnable)`` counts. ``Φ(s_0) = 0``
    (no test run has happened yet). ``f`` is configurable (linear or a sharper
    "near-green" shape that rewards closing the *last* failing test more).
  * Per-transition shaping ``F_k = γ·Φ(s_k) − Φ(s_{k-1})`` for the k-th observed
    test run, credited to the **edit turn that preceded that test run** (the
    action whose effect the test run revealed). Scattered uniformly across that
    turn's ``EDIT``-tagged response tokens (``response_span_tags == SPAN_EDIT``).
  * **Telescoping + bound.** With ``γ=1`` the per-token shaping sums to
    ``Φ(s_final) − Φ(s_0) = Φ(s_final)`` over the trajectory (a true potential
    difference). We additionally clamp the TOTAL shaping magnitude to ``±max_total
    _shaping`` (default 0.3) so the hidden-test outcome reward stays dominant — a
    policy cannot win by gaming shaping while failing the real grade.

The result is a per-token ``token_level_shaping`` list (same length / layout as
``response_ids``) that the generator writes into the Stage-B channel; the
Stage-C advantage estimator (``rloo_n_pbs`` in ``ppo_utils.py``) adds it,
additively + separately, onto RLOO-N's outcome advantage.

Pure / CPU-only; no torch dependency. Unit-testable in isolation.
