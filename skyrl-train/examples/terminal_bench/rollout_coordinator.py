"""K-actor rollout fan-out for terminal-bench RL orchestration.

This module implements the gated, default-OFF rollout fan-out described in
``notes/ot-agent/RL/architecture/skyrl_harbor_rollout_fanout_design.md``.

Motivation (one constraint, not two bugs): the whole rollout-orchestration
tier — the ``submit_batch`` create_task storm, the per-trial Harbor/Terminus2
coroutine bodies, litellm, the ``asyncio.gather`` reconverge, AND the
post-gather token/logprob/reward processing — runs on a SINGLE asyncio loop
inside ONE ``ray::skyrl_entrypoint`` task process, pinning one CPU core while
the rest sit idle. asyncio gives I/O concurrency but no parallelism for the
per-task Python work, and the entrypoint is a ``@ray.remote`` *task* (no
``max_concurrency`` knob).

The fix is more *processes*. We insert a pool of K ``RolloutCoordinator`` Ray
actors between the trainer and the generator:

  * Each actor builds its OWN ``TerminalBenchGenerator`` scoped to the process
    with ``n_concurrent_trials // K`` and ``daytona connection_pool_maxsize // K``
    so the per-process load (and the Daytona control-plane load) is divided,
    not replicated.
  * The clean seam is ``TerminalBenchGenerator.generate(GeneratorInput)
    -> GeneratorOutput`` — already an awaited, serializable-in/serializable-out
    boundary. Because ``generate()`` itself runs ``submit_batch`` + ``gather``
    + ALL post-gather token/logprob/reward shaping (see
    ``terminal_bench_generator.py`` ``generate()`` body), wrapping ``generate()``
    in ``run_shard`` moves *all* of that work off the dispatcher loop and into
    the actor. (This is the CRITICAL move the design calls out — the
    post-gather processing must not survive on the single dispatcher core.)
  * Inference is already a shared HTTP service on its own thread; actors only
    need the host:port string (carried in ``generator_cfg.http_endpoint_*``),
    so weights propagate "for free" via the existing broadcast — actors never
    touch weights.

The ``RolloutDispatcher`` is a thin, generator-interface-compatible object
(NOT a Ray actor) that the trainer holds in place of ``self.generator`` when
fan-out is enabled. It owns NO staleness state (that stays single-loop in
``FullyAsyncRayPPOTrainer`` — same code class that caused prior all_reduce
key-mismatch NCCL deadlocks; must not be distributed). It round-robins each
group-sized ``generate()`` call to ONE coordinator (a group is the atomic
reward-shaping unit, so it is never split across actors) and ``ray.get``s the
compact ``GeneratorOutput`` back.

Default OFF: when ``rollout.fanout.enabled`` is false, the trainer never
constructs any of this and the code path is byte-for-byte the current
behavior. ``enabled: true, num_coordinators: 1`` is behavior-identical modulo
one RPC hop (the K=1 parity check).

    CRITICAL (do not refactor back to a module-top ``from loguru import

    that Ray exports to workers via ``export_actor_class``, which cloudpickles
    the class *by value* (its module ``examples.terminal_bench.rollout_coordinator``
    is not importable on the workers). Cloudpickle's by-value class export walks
    every method's ``__globals__`` for the names the bytecode references
    (``co_names``) and pickles those objects too. Under the forced ``spawn`` start
    method (``main_base.py``), ``skyrl_train.utils.utils.configure_ray_worker_logging``
    has already called ``logger.add(sys.stderr, enqueue=True, ...)`` in this
    process, so the loguru singleton's handler holds a live
    ``multiprocessing.SimpleQueue``. If any method referenced a module-global
    ``logger``, cloudpickle would try to pickle that singleton -> its
    ``SimpleQueue`` -> ``assert_spawning`` -> ``RuntimeError: SimpleQueue objects
    should only be shared between processes through inheritance`` (the crash this
    fix targets). By importing inside the function, ``logger`` is a *local*, not a
    captured module-global, so it is never walked during class export. The actual
    log records are emitted at runtime inside the actor process, where the
    per-process loguru singleton is perfectly usable.
