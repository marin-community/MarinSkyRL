"""Self-contained file-descriptor monitor for the SkyRL RL driver.

This is a minimal, dependency-free port of the FileDescriptorMonitor used in
the OT-Agent datagen path (`hpc/local_runner_utils.py`). It is duplicated here
on purpose so it does NOT need to import anything from OT-Agent — the RL conda
env may not have OT-Agent on its path.

Goal: log file-descriptor usage of the *driver* process (the one that
FD-aborts with `uv__epoll_ctl_prep` SIGABRT on long a3 RL chains) every
`interval` seconds on a daemon thread. Output uses the same `[fd-monitor]`
prefix/format as the datagen monitor so existing greps keep working, and uses
`print(..., flush=True)` so it lands in the SLURM `.out`.

Only start this on the driver / main entrypoint process (not every Ray
worker) to avoid log spam.
