"""Regression guard for init_worker_process_group_with_device (the shared, backend-agnostic
device-pinned NCCL process-group init).

The bug it prevents: creating the NCCL PG without a device_id lets torch's ProcessGroupNCCL
"guess device ID based on global rank" at first-collective time. That guess is not reliably
correct across clusters — on cw-rno2a the first collective (the weight-init barrier) DEADLOCKED
(keep-6 / cw-rno2a, 2026-07-20). NOTE: the live [pg-init] logs show Ray masks CVD to a single
device on BOTH cw-us-east-02a and cw-rno2a (visible_device_count=1), so this was NOT a
masked-vs-unmasked-CVD difference between clusters (an earlier hypothesis the logs disproved) —
the surviving explanation is init ordering (barrier before an explicit set_device). The helper
must therefore always torch.cuda.set_device(LOCAL_RANK) AND pass device_id=cuda:LOCAL_RANK, which
is correct regardless of CVD masking or ordering.
